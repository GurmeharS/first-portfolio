            I am currently a student at the University of Toronto, studying
            Computer Engineering. My current co-op is at IBM, where I am working
            as a Site Reliability Engineer (or a DevOps Developer for you common
            folk).
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a man of many interests. I enjoy sports such as basketball,
            football (both of them), volleyball, and basically everything else.
            I enjoy creating and innovating, in whichever form those come in;
            that could be from programming, to building sandcastles, and
            everything in between.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways, I'm sure you're getting sleepy reading all of this. Me too.
            Feel free to reach out if you want to know more!

            As SREs, we are users of a DevOps methodology. This has provided me
            experience with Agile development tools such as JIRA, Kanban, git,
            and more.
