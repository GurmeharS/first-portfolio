            I am currently a student at the University of Toronto, studying
            Computer Engineering. My current co-op is at IBM, where I am working
            as a Site Reliability Engineer.
            <br />
            I am a man of many interests. I enjoy all sports, some of my
            favourites are: basketball, football (both of them) and volleyball.
            I enjoy creating and innovating, in whichever form those come in;
            that could be from programming, to building sandcastles, and
            everything in between.
            <br />
            Feel free to reach out if you want to know more!

          <h6 class="date">May. 2019 to Now</h6>
          <p class="summary">
            As an SRE at IBM, I have worked on projects that include: coding and
            designing API endpoints, data input and entry using Postgresql,
            chatops, runbook automation, and much more.
            <br />
            These projects have helped expand and develop my growing skillset!
            <br />
            As SREs, we follow a DevOps methodology. This has provided me
            experience with Agile development tools such as JIRA, Kanban, git,
            and more.

            <br />
            I was recognized multiple times by my managers for showing
            initiative and having exceptional people skills.
